QUESTION 4

i. 
a. if n=2 and r=1
	since n>r, the loop will break
	it will also look for the if n<2 but it doesn't fulfil so it's the end of the program 

b. if n=1 and r=1
	n==r, so the iteration will continue to the next one. n=2, from the question i assume r=1. Since n>r, the loop will break and same as part a.

c. if n=2 and r=2
	n==r, it will continue but the iteration is only for range(3), then the else statement will be executed and "Wow, you are lucky" will be printed.

d. if n=0 and r=2
	it does not satisfy line 8 and 9, so x will be printed. it goes back to the iteration, n=1 and r=2, will print x again since doesn't satisfy line 8 and 9. n=2 and r=2. then the same outcome as c after this.



ii.  when n = 2 and r = 2, since n is only in range(3) which is (0,1,2); the iteration ends since the condition is not satisfied and the else statement is printed. "Wow, you are lucky" will be printed. So, when n is out of range, "Wow, you are lucky" will be printed.
