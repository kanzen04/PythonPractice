QUESTION 3

i. c will output [[1,2],3]

ii. Yes the outcome matched my prediction. When we created c, we copied the values of list b. Then we changed a[0]=7, this will be passed onto c because in c there is a which is a direct refernce to a. but when we change b[1]=8, it will not change because we are only copying the values of b and not using its refernce. c[1] however has a reference of a directly when the value of b is copied to it.

***
For Part iii and iv: source codes are available. This is just a short description.
***

iii. to use copy, we need to import copy. then let's say we want to copy c to d, then we can use d = copy.deepcopy(c)

iv. 
	Since part iv asks for outcome. It is also shown in the program.
	d = [[7,[4,6]],3] is the outcome which is  copied from c which is a 3-level list.



QUESTION 4

i. 
a. if n=2 and r=1
	since n>r, the loop will break
	it will also look for the if n<2 but it doesn't fulfil so it's the end of the program 

b. if n=1 and r=1
	n==r, so the iteration will continue to the next one. n=2, from the question i assume r=1. Since n>r, the loop will break and same as part a.

c. if n=2 and r=2
	n==r, it will continue but the iteration is only for range(3), then the else statement will be executed and "Wow, you are lucky" will be printed.

d. if n=0 and r=2
	it does not satisfy line 8 and 9, so x will be printed. it goes back to the iteration, n=1 and r=2, will print x again since doesn't satisfy line 8 and 9. n=2 and r=2. then the same outcome as c after this.



ii.  when n = 2 and r = 2, since n is only in range(3) which is (0,1,2); the iteration ends since the condition is not satisfied and the else statement is printed. "Wow, you are lucky" will be printed. So, when n is out of range, "Wow, you are lucky" will be printed.
